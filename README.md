**1.** **Food Delivery Time Prediction**

This project predicts food delivery times using machine learning models based on real-world factors such as distance, traffic density, weather, restaurant type, and preparation time.

**Project Overview**

Worked on a dataset of 10,000+ food delivery orders.

Performed data preprocessing: handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Conducted EDA to analyze factors affecting delivery time (distance, traffic density, order size).

Built and compared Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

Delivered actionable insights such as:

🚦 Traffic density is a major contributor to delays.

🍽️ Restaurant preparation time heavily impacts delivery times.

📍 Longer distances correlate with higher delivery times.
