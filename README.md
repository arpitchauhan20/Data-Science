# Data-Science
**1.** **Food Delivery Time Prediction:**

This project predicts food delivery times using machine learning models based on real-world factors such as distance, traffic density, weather, restaurant type, and preparation time.

**Project Overview**

    * Worked on a dataset of 10,000+ food delivery orders.
    * Performed data preprocessing: handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
    * Conducted EDA to analyze factors affecting delivery time (distance, traffic density, order size).
    * Built and compared Linear Regression and Random Forest models.

**Delivered actionable insights such as:**

    * Traffic density is a major contributor to delays.
    * Restaurant preparation time heavily impacts delivery times.
    * Longer distances correlate with higher delivery times.


**2. Customer Churn Prediction:**

This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models based on real-world factors such as customer demographics, service usage patterns, contract type, and payment methods.

**Project Overview:**

    * Worked on a dataset of 7,000+ customer records
    * Performed data preprocessing: handled missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.
    * Conducted EDA to analyze factors affecting churn (tenure, monthly charges, contract type).
    * Built and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models.
    * Delivered actionable insights such as:
    * Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn.
    * Higher monthly charges increase churn probability.
    * Customers on month-to-month contracts churn more than those on yearly contracts.
    * Electronic check payments are strongly correlated with churn.


3. **Global Superstore Sales Dashboard (Power BI):**

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing Global Superstore Sales, providing key insights into sales, profit, shipping costs, and customer demand across different regions and categories.

**Project Overview:**

    * Built a Power BI dashboard to visualize 12.64M in total sales and 178K orders.

    * Integrated data from the Global Superstore dataset.

    * Applied data cleaning & transformation in Power Query.

    * Designed dynamic visuals for exploring performance by category, sub-category, region, and shipping mode.

    * Delivered business insights for decision-making and strategy.

**Dashboard Highlights:**

    * Total Sales → 12.64M
    * Total Quantity Sold → 178K
    * Total Shipping Cost → 1.35M
    * Average Profit per Order → 28.61

**Key Visuals:**

**a. Sales & Profit by Sub-Category**

    * Phones, chairs, and storage products contribute the most sales.
    * Some categories (e.g., Tables) show high sales but low or negative profit.

**b. Profit by Shipping Mode:**

    * First Class and Same Day modes account for the largest share of profit.
    * Standard shipping has relatively low profitability.

**c. Sales by Region:**

    * Central and Oceania regions generate the highest sales.
    * South region lags significantly with less than 0.4M in sales.

**dShipping Cost by Category & Ship Mode:**

    * Technology and Furniture categories incur the highest shipping costs.
    * First Class deliveries are costlier across all categories.

**Tools & Technologies:**

    * Power BI Desktop
    * Power Query (data cleaning & transformation)
    * DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for calculated measures
    * Global Superstore dataset (Excel/CSV source)

**Insights & Business Impact:**

    * Phones & Office Supplies are top-selling sub-categories driving revenue.
    * Tables & Furniture show weak profitability despite strong sales → need pricing/discount review.
    * Central & Oceania regions outperform others in sales, while South requires attention.
    * Shipping costs are high in Technology and Furniture categories, especially with First Class  mode → optimize logistics to reduce costs.

**How to Use:**

    * Download the .pbix file from this repo.
    * Open it in Power BI Desktop.
    * Explore interactive filters for Sub-Category and Region.
    * Drill down to analyze sales, profit, and shipping performance.
